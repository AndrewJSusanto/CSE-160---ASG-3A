Objectives:
    - Create a virtual world using textured cubes
    - Perspective camera with movement


First person camera (user) starts in a given position within a 32x32x4 voxel based 3D world.
User navigates using the keyboard and/or mouse to move and rotate camera
    - World fully generated on application start
    - Ground created with a large plane (square) or top of a scaled cube
    - Walls are created with cubes
        - Walls have varying heights in units (1, 2 cubes, etc)
        - Faces of the cubes should be textured to appear as a Walls
    - Sky is created with a very large blue cube that is placed at the center of the world
    - World layout should be specified using a hardcoded javascript 2D array
        - Each element of the array represents height of the wall placed at that location
            - ie. at [1][2] the value is 3 -> A wall of height 3 is at [1][2]
    - Camera controled by keyboard
        - WASD controls with QE turning
Additional reqs:
    - Camera mouse control 
    - Add multiple textures
    - Simple adding and deleting blocks on cursor
    - Add animals to the world 
    - Change ground plane from flat to a terrain mapping OR get obj loader working
    - Add a story/game to the world


3A Portion:
    - Have ground created with a flattened cube and sky from a big cube: 0.5 pts
    - Texture working on at least one object: 1 pts
    - Texture on some objects and color on other. Objects working together: 0.5 pts
    - Multiple textures: 1 pt.


1. Create a new attribute variable to store UV coordinates
